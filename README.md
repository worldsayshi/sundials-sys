# sundials-sys

A barebones `-sys` crate around the [SUNDIALS](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials) suite of ODE solvers. The system must have CMake (`cmake` dependency) and clang (`bindgen` dependency) already installed for compilation to succeed.

## System Dependencies

This library will try to detect whether a system SUNDIALS library is
present (with header files) and otherwise compile a vendored version
of it.  If your SUNDIALS library is installed at an unusual location,
you may declare the environment variables `SUNDIALS_LIBRARY_DIR` and
`SUNDIALS_INCLUDE_DIR` to communicate this to the build script.  You
may force the use of the vendored version by enabling the feature
`build_libraries`.

### Unix

Use your package manager to install `cmake` and `clang`.

System SUNDIALS libraries are available: install `libsundials-dev` for
Debian based systems, `sundials-devel` for Redhat and Suse, and
`sundials` for Arch, MacOS, and the BSD distributions.

### Windows

If you haven't already, you must install [visual studio][],
[enabling][VS] C++ development.  You must also install
[cmake][cmake-ms].  After this, you *must reboot your machine*
otherwise `cmake` will not find the C++ compiler and you will have an
error such as “Generator Visual Studio 16 2019 could not find any
instance of Visual Studio.”

To install a system SUNDIALS, we recommend you install [vcpkg][] and
then issue (from the vcpkg directory):
```
vcpkg install sundials --triplet=x64-windows
```

Alternatively, you may use [Chocolatey][] to install [cmake][] and
[llvm][] (which provides clang).

## Versions
* 0.2.0 — Make compilation of sundials optional (allowing to link against the system library). Add static library option.
* 0.1.1 — removal of (S) libraries from default features, addition of pthreads support if requested
* 0.1.0 — initial `-sys` wrapper with minor tests
